- default value for bindings with converters (as fallback)
- valuetype in bindings, store it and convert value to (or we compare strings)
- binding to signals in scripts (binding does work, but we need ui support)

- a script wich is handeled when a object is destroyed
- parse and jump to javascript, show exportet functions as a dropdown for events

- lazy load custom elements, so ui will be displayed before controls arrive
