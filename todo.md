- default value for bindings with converters (as fallback)
- valuetype in bindings, store it and convert value to (or we compare strings)
- binding to signals in scripts (binding does work, but we need ui support)
- screen selector in switch screen script
- atg selector for signals in scripts and designe rproperty grid

- lazy load custom elements, so ui will be displayed before controls arrive
